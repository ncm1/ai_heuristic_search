\section{Optimization of heuristic algorithm}

\subsection{Overall Optimizations}

When searching for the neighboring nodes to expand to, we can ignore the neighbor that is the parent because the parent was already explored. This saves the computation time of calculating the path and adding/removing from the binary heap.
